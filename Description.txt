Description of Folders

Typologies
- Scripts, data, and results of the cluster analysis to identify patterns (typologies) of pedestrian activity at traffic signals. 

Example Data Collect
- Example scripts, raw data, video, and combined data showing how to collect and process pedestrian event data and combine it with signal data. 

Data
- Data collected and assembled, including about videos, pedestrian crossing events, and combined with signal data. 

Models
- Scripts, data, and results of the regression modeling to develop (factoring) methods to estimate pedestrian volumes from signal data. 

Example Apply Models
- Example scripts, data, and results of applying the regression models to raw signal data and estimating pedestrian volumes. 

Visualization
- Scripts, data, and interfaces that create a prototype to visualize pedestrian signal activity. 

NOTES ON R scripts
- These scripts were written in R. To use, download R (https://cloud.r-project.org/) and then download RStudio (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Then, follow additional instructions in each folder.
