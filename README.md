# Pedestrian traffic signal data (ped-signal-data)

Deliverables from the "Utilizing archived traffic signal performance measures for pedestrian planning & analysis" research project UT18.602, funded by the Utah Department of Transportation, and carried out by [Patrick Singleton](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/people/faculty/singleton-patrick),[Prasanna Humagain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prasanna-humagain-b15585137/) and the [Singleton Transportation Lab](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/research/labs/patrick-singleton/index) at Utah State University.

## Description of Folders

**Typologies**: Scripts, data, and results of the cluster analysis to identify patterns (typologies) of pedestrian activity at traffic signals. 

**Temporal Patterns**: Scripts and data resulting from the analysis of temporal patterns and spatial characteristics of pedestrian push-button data. 

**Example Data Collect**: Example scripts, raw data, video, and combined data showing how to collect and process pedestrian event data and combine it with signal data. 

**Data**: Data collected and assembled, including about videos, pedestrian crossing events, and combined with signal data. 

**Models**: Scripts, data, and results of the regression modeling to develop (factoring) methods to estimate pedestrian volumes from signal data. 

**Example Apply Models**: Example scripts, data, and results of applying the regression models to raw signal data and estimating pedestrian volumes. 

**Visualization**: Scripts, data, and interfaces that create a prototype to visualize pedestrian signal activity. 

**Presentation**: PDF of Powerpoint presentation provided to UDOT in August 2020. 

**NOTES ON R scripts**: These scripts were written in R. To use, download R (https://cloud.r-project.org/) and then download RStudio (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download). Then, follow additional instructions in each folder.
