# Pedestrian traffic signal data (ped-signal-data)

Deliverables from the "Utilizing archived traffic signal performance measures for pedestrian planning & analysis" research project UT18.602, funded by the Utah Department of Transportation, and carried out by [Patrick Singleton](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/people/faculty/singleton-patrick) and the [Singleton Transportation Lab](https://engineering.usu.edu/cee/research/labs/patrick-singleton/index) at Utah State University.

## Description of Folders

### Typologies
- Scripts, data, and results of the cluster analysis to identify patterns (typologies) of pedestrian activity at traffic signals. 

### Example Data Collect
- Example scripts, raw data, video, and combined data showing how to collect and process pedestrian event data and combine it with signal data. 

### Data
- Data collected and assembled, including about videos, pedestrian crossing events, and combined with signal data. 

### Models
- Scripts, data, and results of the regression modeling to develop (factoring) methods to estimate pedestrian volumes from signal data. 

### Example Apply Models
- Example scripts, data, and results of applying the regression models to raw signal data and estimating pedestrian volumes. 

### Visualization
- Scripts, data, and interfaces that create a prototype to visualize pedestrian signal activity. 

### Report
- Link to PDF research project report published by the Utah Department of Transportation in fall 2020. 

### Presentation
- PDF of Powerpoint presentation provided to UDOT in August 2020. 

### Papers
- Links to papers published related to this project. 

### NOTES ON R scripts
