Instructions
- To run a R script, double click on the file, which should open in RStudio. Then highlight the lines of code you wish to run, and click the Run button. 
- To load a rds file into R, use the command and assignment: temp <- readRDS(...) where ... = file name (and path) in quotes, and temp is the object name you want it to be stored under in R. For example, the script uses: sigtab <- readRDS("sigtab.rds")
