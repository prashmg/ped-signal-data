Instructions
- To run a R script, double click on the file, which should open in RStudio. Then highlight the lines of code you wish to run, and click the Run button. 
- To load a RData file into R, use the command: load(...) where ... = file name (and path) in quotes. For example, the app script uses: load(file="videos.Rdata")
