Instructions
- To run the R app script, double click on the file, which should open in RStudio. Then click the Run App button. 
- To load a rds file into R, use the command and assignment: temp <- readRDS(...) where ... = file name (and path) in quotes, and temp is the object name you want it to be stored under in R. For example, the script uses: dat19 <- readRDS(file=paste0("Data", "/", "dat19.rds"))
